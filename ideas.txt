Plans for this project:

- Adding a Front End, even if it's just a basic html file being served up after the data is scraped, that would be cool

- Set up another project that will be used to make requests against



-- Make a script that pulls the latest comments from u/shitty_watercolour and then displays them on a page



Notes exported from the app.py:
# Moving forward:
#  Build an array using the values that we extract
#  Deliver that array to a Vue Interface to modify the display
#  Store scraped data in a database
#  
# Remember 
#  dont go overboard on my calls! No more than 1 a second! :U
#  Only scrape from sites that allow their data to be scraped in their terms
